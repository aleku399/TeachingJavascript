const name = 'Alex'; // its in quotes because its a string
const age = 13 // its not in quotes coz its a number
const age2 = 15
const sum = age + age2
const list = [3, 3, 4] // a list of numbers
const listOfnames = ['allan', 'Betty'] // a list of strings


// assignment

// function for printing content is console.log
console.log(' allan is here ');
console.log(name)
console.log(' sum of ages: ' + sum)
